# Import the DefaultAzureCredential class from the azure.identity module

# from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
# from azure.keyvault.secrets import SecretClient
# import os

# vault_url = os.getenv("VAULT_URL")  # e.g. "https://<YourVaultName>.vault.azure.net"
# credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
